1. n is is stored as -24(%rbp), while is_even is stored as a flag inside %eax, however in next version it contains 0 
local variables

2. leaq    1(%rdi,%rdi,2), %rdi
3. The compiler does the 3n - 1 step but then proceeds to even it by /2 doing 2 steps in one go 
4. map poly contains vmul amd vadd instructions implying vectorization, so was dot_single as it also used vadd and vmul, 
but it was using vadss implying single precision, wheras map_poly used vaddps imply packed single
5. it removed horizontal additions
6. It was faster then the assembly one.
