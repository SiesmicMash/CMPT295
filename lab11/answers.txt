1-2.  For the dot double the difference was ~25% faster
        dot_double took    21.4 ms
        dot_double_vec took    16.1 ms
        dot_double_vc took    15.6 ms

    For the dot single the difference was about 3x faster 
        dot_single took    25.2 ms
        dot_single_vec took     8.0 ms
        dot_single_vc took     7.7 ms

    For the map_poly_double functions the difference was almost 3x faster
        map_poly_double took    71.2 ms
        map_poly_double_vec took    22.0 ms
        map_poly_double_vc took    21.7 ms

    For the map_poly_single functions the vectorized approach was 6x faster
        map_poly_single took    63.5 ms
        map_poly_single_vec took    10.8 ms
        map_poly_single_vc took    10.7 ms

3. The main reason that I can assume is that for the dot_product the compiler will have to follow exactly as
the code is implemented, which also means using the inefficent horizontal add that the compiler is locked into 
using. Where as the vectorization of the polynomial function doesn't require the horizontal add.
